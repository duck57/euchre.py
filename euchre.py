Double-deck bid euchre

Implementation is similar to the rules given by Craig Powers 
https://www.pagat.com/euchre/bideuch.html

Notable differences (to match how I learned in high school calculus) include:
    * Minimum bid of 6 (which can be stuck to the dealer)
    * Shooters and loners are separate bids (guessing as Â±18 for shooter, similar to a loner)
    * Shooters are a mandatory 2 card exchange with your partner
    * Trump isn't announced until after bidding has conculded
    * Winner of bid leads the first hand
    * Winning your bid gives you (tricks eaned + 2) points

Mothjab is a funny word with no current meaning.
