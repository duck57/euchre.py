# Double-deck bid euchre

Implementation is similar to [the rules given by Craig Powers](
https://www.pagat.com/euchre/bideuch.html).

Notable differences (to match how I learned in high school calculus) include:
* Minimum bid of 6 (which can be stuck to the dealer)
* Shooters and loners are separate bids (guessing as Â±18 for shooter)
* Shooters are a mandatory 2 card exchange with your partner
* Trump isn't announced until after bidding has concluded
* Winner of bid leads the first hand
* Winning your bid gives you `(tricks earned + 2)` points
